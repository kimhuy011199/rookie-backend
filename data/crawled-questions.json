The result is instead very different, and very astonishing (for a novice):\n\n```\n>>> foo()\n[5]\n>>> foo()\n[5, 5]\n>>> foo()\n[5, 5, 5]\n>>> foo()\n[5, 5, 5, 5]\n>>> foo()\n```\n\nA manager of mine once had his first encounter with this feature, and called it \"a dramatic design flaw\" of the language. I replied that the behavior had an underlying explanation, and it is indeed very puzzling and unexpected if you don't understand the internals. However, I was not able to answer (to myself) the following question: what is the reason for binding the default argument at function definition, and not at function execution? I doubt the experienced behavior has a practical use (who really used static variables in C, without breeding bugs?)\n\n**Edit**:\n\n[Baczek made an interesting example](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1137164/7487335). Together with most of your comments and [Utaal's in particular](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1134623/7487335), I elaborated further:\n\n```\n>>> def a():\n...     print(\"a executed\")\n...     return []\n... \n>>>            \n>>> def b(x=a()):\n...     x.append(5)\n...     print(x)\n... \na executed\n>>> b()\n[5]\n>>> b()\n[5, 5]\n```\n\nTo me, it seems that the design decision was relative to where to put the scope of parameters: inside the function, or \"together\" with it?\n\nDoing the binding inside the function would mean that `x` is effectively bound to the specified default when the function is called, not defined, something that would present a deep flaw: the `def` line would be \"hybrid\" in the sense that part of the binding (of the function object) would happen at definition, and part (assignment of default parameters) at function invocation time.\n\nThe actual behavior is more consistent: everything of that line gets evaluated when that line is executed, meaning at function definition."

Just surround the search terms by quotes, e.g. [`[php] \"==\" vs \"===\"`](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=%5Bphp%5D%20%22===%22%20vs%20%22==%22)\n\n### **What should I do here?**\n\nIf you have been pointed here by someone because you have asked such a question, please find the particular syntax below.

    "title": "How does PHP 'foreach' actually work?",
    "content": "Let me prefix this by saying that I know what `foreach` is, does and how to use it. This question concerns how it works under the bonnet, and I don't want any answers along the lines of \"this is how you loop an array with `foreach`\".\n\n* * *\n\nFor a long time I assumed that `foreach` worked with the array itself. Then I found many references to the fact that it works with a _copy_ of the array, and I have since assumed this to be the end of the story. But I recently got into a discussion on the matter, and after a little experimentation found that this was not in fact 100% true.\n\nLet me show what I mean. For the following test cases, we will be working with the following array:\n\n```\n$array = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\n```\n\n[Test case 1](http://codepad.org/7DIeObk9):\n\n```\nforeach ($array as $item) {\n  echo \"$item\\n\";\n  $array[] = $item;\n}\nprint_r($array);\n\n/* Output in loop:    1 2 3 4 5\n   $array after loop: 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 */\n```\n\nThis clearly shows that we are not working directly with the source array - otherwise the loop would continue forever, since we are constantly pushing items onto the array during the loop. But just to be sure this is the case:\n\n[Test case 2](http://codepad.org/nirz6Ufh):\n\n```\nforeach ($array as $key => $item) {\n  $array[$key + 1] = $item + 2;\n  echo \"$item\\n\";\n}\n\nprint_r($array);\n\n/* Output in loop:    1 2 3 4 5\n   $array after loop: 1 3 4 5 6 7 */\n```\n\nThis backs up our initial conclusion, we are working with a copy of the source array during the loop, otherwise we would see the modified values during the loop. _But..._\n\nIf we look in the [manual](http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.foreach.php), we find this statement:\n\n> When foreach first starts executing, the internal array pointer is automatically reset to the first element of the array.\n\nRight... this seems to suggest that `foreach` relies on the array pointer of the source array. But we've just proved that we're _not working with the source array_, right? Well, not entirely.\n\n[Test case 3](http://codepad.org/6n20ooMy):\n\n```\n// Move the array pointer on one to make sure it doesn't affect the loop\nvar_dump(each($array));\n\nforeach ($array as $item) {\n  echo \"$item\\n\";\n}\n\nvar_dump(each($array));\n\n/* Output\n  array(4) {\n    [1]=>\n    int(1)\n    [\"value\"]=>\n    int(1)\n    [0]=>\n    int(0)\n    [\"key\"]=>\n    int(0)\n  }\n  1\n  2\n  3\n  4\n  5\n  bool(false)\n*/\n```\n\nSo, despite the fact that we are not working directly with the source array, we are working directly with the source array pointer - the fact that the pointer is at the end of the array at the end of the loop shows this. Except this can't be true - if it was, then [test case 1](http://codepad.org/7DIeObk9) would loop forever.\n\nThe PHP manual also states:\n\n> As foreach relies on the internal array pointer changing it within the loop may lead to unexpected behavior.\n\nWell, let's find out what that \"unexpected behavior\" is (technically, any behavior is unexpected since I no longer know what to expect).\n\n[Test case 4](http://codepad.org/JJp79xSd):\n\n```\nforeach ($array as $key => $item) {\n  echo \"$item\\n\";\n  each($array);\n}\n\n/* Output: 1 2 3 4 5 */\n```\n\n[Test case 5](http://codepad.org/IfwJyTCL):\n\n```\nforeach ($array as $key => $item) {\n  echo \"$item\\n\";\n  reset($array);\n}\n\n/* Output: 1 2 3 4 5 */\n```\n\n...nothing that unexpected there, in fact it seems to support the \"copy of source\" theory.\n\n* * *\n\n**The Question**\n\nWhat is going on here? My C-fu is not good enough for me to able to extract a proper conclusion simply by looking at the PHP source code, I would appreciate it if someone could translate it into English for me.\n\nIt seems to me that `foreach` works with a _copy_ of the array, but sets the array pointer of the source array to the end of the array after the loop.\n\n*   Is this correct and the whole story?\n*   If not, what is it really doing?\n*   Is there any situation where using functions that adjust the array pointer (`each()`, `reset()` et al.) during a `foreach` could affect the outcome of the loop?"

The tables were just basic stuff with some border styles to add some lines at various points;\n*   [HTML2PDF and HTML2PS](https://github.com/spipu/html2pdf): I actually had better luck with this. It rendered some of the images (all the images are Google Chart URLs) and the table formatting was much better but it seemed to have some complexity problem I haven't figured out yet and kept dying with unknown node\\_type() errors. Not sure where to go from here; and\n*   [Htmldoc](http://www.msweet.org/projects.php?Z1): this seems to work fine on basic HTML but has almost no support for CSS whatsoever so you have to do everything in HTML (I didn't realize it was still 2001 in Htmldoc-land...) so it's useless to me.\n\nI tried a Windows app called Html2Pdf Pilot that actually did a pretty decent job but I need something that at a minimum runs on Linux and ideally runs on-demand via PHP on the Webserver.\n\nWhat am I missing, or how can I resolve this issue?"

I would love to use enums as a way to give predefined values which IDEs' auto-completion features could understand.\n\nConstants do the trick, but there's the namespace collision problem and (or actually _because_) they're global. Arrays don't have the namespace problem, but they're too vague, they can be overwritten at runtime and IDEs rarely know how to autofill their keys without additional static analysis annotations or attributes.\n\nAre there any solutions/workarounds you commonly use?

Then I add a Top Space constraint to the UILabel (no problem) (and I can even pin height / width of the label, changes nothing, but should be unneccessary due to the Label's intrinsic size)\n\n**The trouble starts when I add a trailing constraint to the UILabel:**\n\nE.g., Trailing Space to: Superview Equals: 25\n\nNow two warnings occur - and I don't understand why:\n\n**A)** Scrollable Content Size Ambiguity (Scroll View has ambiguous scrollable content height/width)\n\n**B)** Misplaced Views (Label Expected: x= -67 Actual: x= 207\n\nI did this minimal example in a freshly new project which you can download and I attached a screenshot. As you can see, Interface Builder expects the Label to sit outside of the UIScrollView's boundary (the orange dashed rectangle). Updating the Label's frame with the Resolve Issues Tool moves it right there.\n\nPlease note: If you replace the UIScrollView with a UIView, the behaviour is as expected (the Label's frame is correct and according to the constraint). So there seems to either be an issue with UIScrollView or I am missing out on something important.\n\nWhen I run the App without updating the Label's frame as suggested by IB it is positioned just fine, exactly where it's supposed to be and the UIScrollView is scrollable. If I DO update the frame the Label is out of sight and the UIScrollView does not scroll.\n\n**Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi! Why the ambiguous layout?

However, if I simply call `this.setState()` instead of `this.render()`, it works fine.\n\n**So I guess my question is:** do React components _need_ to have state in order to rerender?

Why would I want to use Redux Thunk or Redux Promise, as the documentation suggests?\n\n**EDIT:** I searched the Redux repo for clues, and found that Action Creators were required to be pure functions in the past. For example, [here's a user trying to provide a better explanation for async data flow:](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues/533)\n\n> The action creator itself is still a pure function, but the thunk function it returns doesn't need to be, and it can do our async calls\n\n[Action creators are no longer required to be pure.](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues/1088) So, thunk/promise middleware was definitely required in the past, but it seems that this is no longer the case?"

    "content": "I am currently migrating a React application to TypeScript. So far, this works pretty well, but I have a problem with the return types of my `render` functions, specifically in my functional components.\n\nI have always used `JSX.Element` as the return type, now this doesn't work any more if a component decides to _not_ render anything, i.e. returns `null`, since `null` is not a valid value for `JSX.Element`. This was the beginning of my journey. I searched the web and found that you should use `ReactNode` instead, which includes `null` and a few other things that can happen.\n\nHowever, when creating a functional component, TypeScript complains about the `ReactNode` type. Again, after some searching I found, that for functional components you should use `ReactElement` instead. However, if I do so, the compatibility issue is gone, but now TypeScript again complains about `null` not being a valid value.\n\nTo cut a long story short, I have three questions:\n\n1.  What is the difference between `JSX.Element`, `ReactNode` and `ReactElement`?\n2.  Why do the `render` methods of class components return `ReactNode`, but functional components return `ReactElement`?\n3.  How do I solve this with respect to `null`?"

That also seems very unnecessary, slow, and in the wrong place (doing database calls there) but I could be wrong. Or where else would that data come from?\n\nSo I thought, whenever a user logs in, I can add some necessary variables in my session, which I add to the custom IIdentity in the `Application_PostAuthenticateRequest` event handler. However, my `Context.Session` is `null` there, so that is also not the way to go.\n\nI've been working on this for a day now and I feel I'm missing something. This shouldn't be too hard to do, right? I'm also a bit confused by all the (semi)related stuff that comes with this. `MembershipProvider`, `MembershipUser`, `RoleProvider`, `ProfileProvider`, `IPrincipal`, `IIdentity`, `FormsAuthentication`.... Am I the only one who finds all this very confusing?\n\nIf someone could tell me a simple, elegant, and efficient solution to store some extra data on a IIdentity without all the extra fuzz.. that would be great! I know there are similar questions on SO but if the answer I need is in there, I must've overlooked."

    "title": "IIS AppPoolIdentity and file system write access permissions",
    "content": "Here's an issue with IIS 7.5 and ASP.NET that I've been researching and getting nowhere with. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nMy question is: using ASP.NET in IIS 7.5, how does IIS and/or the operating system allow the web application to write to a folder like `C:\\dump` when running under full trust? How is it that I don't have to explicitly add write access for the application pool user (in this case `ApplicationPoolIdentity`)?\n\nThis much I know:\n\n*   In IIS 7.5, the default Identity for an Application Pool is `ApplicationPoolIdentity`.\n*   `ApplicationPoolIdentity` represents a Windows user account called \"IIS APPPOOL\\\\AppPoolName\", which is created when the Application Pool is created, where AppPoolName is the name of the Application Pool.\n*   The \"IIS APPPOOL\\\\AppPoolName\" user is by default a member of the `IIS_IUSRS` group.\n*   If you are running under Full Trust, your web application can write to many areas of the file system (excluding folders like `C:\\Users`, `C:\\Windows`, etc). For example, your application will have access to write to some folders, like, `C:\\dump`.\n*   By default, the `IIS_IUSRS` group is not given read or write access to `C:\\dump` (at least not access that is visible through the \"Security\" tab in Windows Explorer).\n*   If you deny write access to `IIS_IUSRS`, you will get a SecurityException when trying to write to the folder (as expected).\n\nSo, taking all of that into account, how is write access granted to the \"IIS APPPOOL\\\\AppPoolName\" user? The w3wp.exe process runs as this user, so what allows this user to write to a folder it doesn't seem to have explicit access to?\n\nPlease note that I understand this was probably done for the sake of convenience, since it would be a pain to grant a user access to every folder it needs to write to if you are running under Full Trust. If you want to limit this access, you can always run the application under Medium Trust. I am interested in finding out about the way the operating system and/or IIS allows these writes to take place, even though there appears to be no explicit file system access granted."

Rails does this by default when it adds `//= require_tree .` to the bottom of your `application.js` manifest file.\n\nThis sounds like a real life-saver, but I am a little concerned about page-specific JavaScript code. Does this code get executed on every page? The last thing I want is for all of my objects to be instantiated for every page when they are only needed on 1 page.\n\nAlso, isn't there potential for code that clashes too?\n\nOr do you put a small `script` tag at the bottom of the page that just calls into a method that executes the javascript code for the page?\n\nDo you no longer need require.js then?\n\nThanks\n\n**EDIT**: I appreciate all the answers... and I don't think they are really getting at the problem. Some of them are about styling and don't seem to relate... and others just mention `javascript_include_tag`... which I know exists (obviously...) but it would appear that the Rails 3.1 way going forward is to wrap up all of your JavaScript into 1 file rather than loading individual JavaScript at the bottom of each page.\n\nThe best solution I can come up with is to wrap certain features in `div` tags with `id`s or `class`es. In the JavaScript code, you just check if the `id` or `class` is on the page, and if it is, you run the JavaScript code that is associated with it. This way if the dynamic element is not on the page, the JavaScript code doesn't run - even though it's been included in the massive `application.js` file packaged by Sprockets.\n\nMy above solution has the benefit that if a search box is included on 8 of the 100 pages, it will run on only those 8 pages. You also won't have to include the same code on 8 of the pages on the site. In fact, you'll never have to include manual script tags on your site anywhere ever again.\n\nI think this is the actual answer to my question."

The only way I can get a join is to use `:joins` instead of `:include`:\n\n```\nPost.all(:joins => :comments)\n```\n\nAnd the logs show:\n\n```\nPost Load (6.0ms)  SELECT \"posts\".* FROM \"posts\" \n                   INNER JOIN \"comments\" ON \"posts\".id = \"comments\".post_id\n```\n\nAm I missing something? I have an app with half a dozen associations and on one screen I display data from all of them. Seems like it would be better to have one join-ed query instead of 6 individuals. I know that performance-wise it's not always better to do a join rather than individual queries (in fact if you're going by time spent, it looks like the two individual queries above are faster than the join), but after all the docs I've been reading I'm surprised to see `:include` not working as advertised.\n\nMaybe Rails _is_ cognizant of the performance issue and doesn't join except in certain cases?"

This code is confusing and, after a certain time, I cease to understand what is really happening.\n\nHere is what bothers me:\n\n1.  I find it ugly that my model level (which was supposed to be responsible only for the work with data from a database) is also sending email, walking on API to other services, etc.\n2.  Also, I find it unacceptable to place business logic in the view, because this way it becomes difficult to control. For example, in my application there are at least three ways to create new instances of `User`, but technically it should create them uniformly.\n3.  I do not always notice when the methods and properties of my models become non-deterministic and when they develop side effects.\n\nHere is a simple example. At first, the `User` model was like this:\n\n```\nclass User(db.Models):\n\n    def get_present_name(self):\n        return self.name or 'Anonymous'\n\n    def activate(self):\n        self.status = 'activated'\n        self.save()\n```\n\nOver time, it turned into this:\n\n```\nclass User(db.Models):\n\n    def get_present_name(self): \n        # property became non-deterministic in terms of database\n        # data is taken from another service by api\n        return remote_api.request_user_name(self.uid) or 'Anonymous' \n\n    def activate(self):\n        # method now has a side effect (send message to user)\n        self.status = 'activated'\n        self.save()\n        send_mail('Your account is activated!', '…', [self.email])\n```\n\nWhat I want is to separate entities in my code:\n\n1.  **Database level entities, i.e. database level logic: What kind of data does my application store?**\n2.  **application level entities, i.e. business level logic: What does my application do?**\n\nWhat are the good practices to implement such an approach that can be applied in Django?"

And what’s wrong with them?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/409338/examples-of-the-best-soap-rest-rpc-web-apis-and-why-do-you-like-them-and-whats)\n\nI'm thinking of using a simplified version of [Amazon S3's authentication](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/2006-03-01/index.html?RESTAuthentication.html) (I like [OAuth](http://oauth.net/) but it seems too complicated for my needs). I'm adding a randomly generated [nonce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce), supplied by the server, to the request, to prevent replay attacks.\n\nTo get to the question:\n\nBoth S3 and OAuth rely on signing the request URL along with a few selected headers. **Neither of them sign the request body** for POST or PUT requests. Isn't this vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, which keeps the url and headers and replaces the request body with any data the attacker wants?\n\nIt seems like I can guard against this by including a hash of the request body in the string that gets signed. Is this secure?"

The blog post I linked to above, which is the only one I found detailing the change, seems to imply that you can only enable gzipping (bar workarounds, which I don't want to use), if you opt for custom origin, which I'd rather not: I find it simpler to host the coresponding fileds on my Cloudfront server, and link to them from there.

The advantage of this filesystem is that you can access files on S3 that were written with other tools. Conversely, other tools can access files written using Hadoop. The disadvantage is the 5GB limit on file size imposed by S3.\n> \n> S3A (URI scheme: s3a) A successor to the S3 Native, s3n fs, the S3a: system uses Amazon's libraries to interact with S3. This allows S3a to support larger files (no more 5GB limit), higher performance operations and more. The filesystem is intended to be a replacement for/successor to S3 Native: all objects accessible from s3n:// URLs should also be accessible from s3a simply by replacing the URL schema.\n> \n> S3 Block FileSystem (URI scheme: s3) A block-based filesystem backed by S3. Files are stored as blocks, just like they are in HDFS. This permits efficient implementation of renames. This filesystem requires you to dedicate a bucket for the filesystem - you should not use an existing bucket containing files, or write other files to the same bucket. The files stored by this filesystem can be larger than 5GB, but they are not interoperable with other S3 tools.\n\nWhy a letter change on the URI could make such difference? For example\n\n```\nval data = sc.textFile(\"s3n://bucket-name/key\")\n```\n\nto\n\n```\nval data = sc.textFile(\"s3a://bucket-name/key\")\n```\n\nWhat is the technical difference underlying this change?

However, as it turns out, a factory object is a singleton too?\n\nExample code to demonstrate:\n\n```\nvar factories = angular.module('app.factories', []);\nvar app = angular.module('app',  ['ngResource', 'app.factories']);\n\nfactories.factory('User', function () {\n  return {\n    first: 'John',\n    last: 'Doe'\n  };\n});\n\napp.controller('ACtrl', function($scope, User) {\n  $scope.user = User;\n});\n\napp.controller('BCtrl', function($scope, User) {\n  $scope.user = User;\n});\n```\n\nWhen changing `user.first` in `ACtrl` it turns out that `user.first` in `BCtrl` is also changed, e.g. `User` is a singleton?\n\nMy assumption was that a new instance was injected in a controller with a factory?"

I'm doing this by passing `$routeParams` to the main app module. Here is an example of what's in my app:\n\n```\nangular.module('myApp', []).\n    config(['$routeProvider', function($routeProvider) {\n        $routeProvider.                     \n            when(\"/job/:jobId/zones/:zoneId\", { controller: JobDetailController, templateUrl: 'assets/job_list_app/templates/zone_edit.html' }).\n            when(\"/job/:jobId/initial_inspection\", { controller: JobDetailController, templateUrl: 'assets/job_list_app/templates/initial_inspection.html' }).\n            when(\"/job/:jobId/zones/:zoneId/rooms/:roomId\", { controller: JobDetailController, templateUrl: 'assets/job_list_app/templates/room_edit.html' })       \n\n    }]);\n```\n\n**In circle 2**, the template that is loaded into the `ng-view` has an additional **sub-navigation**. This sub-nav then needs to load templates into the area below it - but since ng-view is already being used, I'm not sure how to go about doing this.\n\nI know that I can include additional templates within the 1st template, but these templates are all going to be pretty complex. I would like to keep all the templates separate in order to make the application easier to update and not have a dependency on the parent template having to be loaded in order to access its children.\n\n**In circle 3**, you can see things get even more complex. There is the potential that the sub-navigation templates will have a **2nd sub-navigation** that will need to load its own templates as well into the area in **circle 4**\n\n**How does one go about structuring an AngularJS app to deal with such complex nesting of templates while keeping them all separate from one another?**"

As far as I can tell from reading some of the other questions asked [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12657389/angularjs-load-service-then-call-controller-and-render) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15164013/json-to-initialize-data-in-service) I have a few options, but none of them seem very clean (perhaps I am missing something):\n\n**Setup Service with \"run\"**\n\nWhen setting up my app do this:\n\n```\nmyApp.run(function ($http, MyService) {\n    $http.get('data.json').success(function (data) {\n        MyService.setData(data);\n    });\n});\n```\n\nThen my service would look like this:\n\n```\nmyModule.service('MyService', function() {\n    var myData = null;\n    return {\n        setData: function (data) {\n            myData = data;\n        },\n        doStuff: function () {\n            return myData.getSomeData();\n        }\n    };\n});\n```\n\nThis works some of the time but if the asynchronous data happens to take longer than it takes for everything to get initialized I get a null pointer exception when I call `doStuff()`\n\n**Use promise objects**\n\nThis would probably work. The only downside it everywhere I call MyService I will have to know that doStuff() returns a promise and all the code will have to us `then` to interact with the promise. I would rather just wait until myData is back before loading the my application.\n\n**Manual Bootstrap**\n\n```\nangular.element(document).ready(function() {\n    $.getJSON(\"data.json\", function (data) {\n       // can't initialize the data here because the service doesn't exist yet\n       angular.bootstrap(document);\n       // too late to initialize here because something may have already\n       // tried to call doStuff() and would have got a null pointer exception\n    });\n});\n```\n\n**Global Javascript Var** I could send my JSON directly to a global Javascript variable:\n\nHTML:\n\n```\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"data.js\"></script>\n```\n\ndata.js:\n\n```\nvar dataForMyService = { \n// myData here\n};\n```\n\nThen it would be available when initializing `MyService`:\n\n```\nmyModule.service('MyService', function() {\n    var myData = dataForMyService;\n    return {\n        doStuff: function () {\n            return myData.getSomeData();\n        }\n    };\n});\n```\n\nThis would work too, but then I have a global javascript variable which smells bad.\n\nAre these my only options? Are one of these options better than the others? I know this is a pretty long question, but I wanted to show that I have tried to explore all my options. Any guidance would greatly be appreciated."

I'm looking for a similar functionality to REPLACE() function - simplified example follows:\n\n```\nSELECT REPLACE('stackowerflow', 'ower', 'over');\n\nOutput: \"stackoverflow\"\n\n/* does something like this exist? */\nSELECT X_REG_REPLACE('Stackoverflow','/[A-Zf]/','-'); \n\nOutput: \"-tackover-low\"\n```\n\nI know about [REGEXP/RLIKE](https://stackoverflow.com/a/6943142/19746), but those only check _if_ there is a match, not _what_ the match is.\n\n(I _could_ do a \"`SELECT pkey_id,filename FROM foo WHERE filename RLIKE '[^a-zA-Z0-9()_ .\\-]'`\" from a PHP script, do a `preg_replace` and then \"`UPDATE foo ...

And then the function removes that node and puts it in the correct node. This has been implemented because of the ability to work offline.\n\nOur current problem is the speed of the function. The function itself takes about 400ms, so that's alright. But sometimes the functions take a very long time (around 8 seconds), while the entry was already added to the queue.\n\nWe suspect that the server takes time to boot up, because when we do the action once more after the first. It takes way less time.\n\nIs there any way to fix this problem? Down here i added the code of our function.

I have tens of thousands.\n\nI'm beginning to think the only solution is to create a file with a list of files/folders to be excluded, then use rsync with `--exclude-from=file` to copy all the files to a tmp directory, and then use tar to archive that directory.\n\nCan anybody think of a better/more efficient solution?\n\nEDIT: **Charles Ma**'s solution works well. The big gotcha is that the `--exclude='./folder'` **MUST** be at the beginning of the tar command. Full command (cd first, so backup is relative to that directory):\n\n```\ncd /folder_to_backup\ntar --exclude='./folder' --exclude='./upload/folder2' -zcvf /backup/filename.tgz .\n```"

Would there ever be a need to expose a port first, and _not_ publish it later?

    "content": "What is the best way to represent and solve a maze given an image?\n\n![The cover image of The Scope Issue 134](https://i.stack.imgur.com/TqKCM.jpg)\n\nGiven an JPEG image (as seen above), what's the best way to read it in, parse it into some data structure and solve the maze? My first instinct is to read the image in pixel by pixel and store it in a list (array) of boolean values: `True` for a white pixel, and `False` for a non-white pixel (the colours can be discarded). The issue with this method, is that the image may not be \"pixel perfect\". By that I simply mean that if there is a white pixel somewhere on a wall it may create an unintended path.\n\nAnother method (which came to me after a bit of thought) is to convert the image to an SVG file - which is a list of paths drawn on a canvas. This way, the paths could be read into the same sort of list (boolean values) where `True` indicates a path or wall, `False` indicating a travel-able space. An issue with this method arises if the conversion is not 100% accurate, and does not fully connect all of the walls, creating gaps.\n\nAlso an issue with converting to SVG is that the lines are not \"perfectly\" straight. This results in the paths being cubic bezier curves. With a list (array) of boolean values indexed by integers, the curves would not transfer easily, and all the points that line on the curve would have to be calculated, but won't exactly match to list indices.\n\nI assume that while one of these methods may work (though probably not) that they are woefully inefficient given such a large image, and that there exists a better way. How is this best (most efficiently and/or with the least complexity) done? Is there even a best way?\n\nThen comes the solving of the maze. If I use either of the first two methods, I will essentially end up with a matrix. According to [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3097677/1267663), a good way to represent a maze is using a tree, and a good way to solve it is using the [A\\* algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%2a_search_algorithm). How would one create a tree from the image? Any ideas?\n\n**TL;DR**  \nBest way to parse? Into what data structure? How would said structure help/hinder solving?\n\n**UPDATE**  \nI've tried my hand at implementing what @Mikhail has written in Python, using `numpy`, as @Thomas recommended.

Am I doing it wrong (which is certainly possible as I have rather limited MATLAB experience), or does MATLAB's OOP just introduce a lot of overhead?\n\n**My test case**\n\nHere's the simple test I did for string, basically just appending a string and removing the appended part again:\n\n> Note: Don't actually write a String class like this in real code!

So I was wondering that maybe much more overhead is involved in looking up class or package function vs functions that are in the path. I tried to test this, and it just gets stranger. To rule out the influence of classes/objects, I compared calling a function in the path vs a function in a package:\n\n```\nfunction n = atest( x, y )\n  n = ctest( x, y ); % ctest is in matlab path\n\nfunction n = btest( x, y )\n  n = util.ctest( x, y ); % ctest is in +util directory, parent directory is in path\n```\n\nResults, gathered same way as above:\n\n> atest 0.004 sec, 0.001 sec in ctest\n> \n> btest 0.060 sec, 0.014 sec in util.ctest\n\nSo, is all this overhead just coming from MATLAB spending time looking up definitions for its OOP implementation, whereas this overhead is not there for functions that are directly in the path?"

    "content": "Does MATLAB have any support for hash tables?\n\n* * *\n\nSome background\n---------------\n\nI am working on a problem in Matlab that requires a scale-space representation of an image. To do this I create a 2-D Gaussian filter with variance `sigma*s^k` for `k` in some range., and then I use each one in turn to filter the image. Now, I want some sort of mapping from `k` to the filtered image.\n\nIf `k` were always an integer, I'd simply create a 3D array such that:\n\n```\narr[k] = <image filtered with k-th guassian>\n```\n\nHowever, `k` is not necessarily an integer, so I can't do this. What I thought of doing was keeping an array of `k`s such that:\n\n```\narr[find(array_of_ks_ = k)] = <image filtered with k-th guassian>\n```\n\nWhich seems pretty good at first thought, except I will be doing this lookup potentially a few thousand times with about 20 or 30 values of `k`, and I fear that this will hurt performance.\n\nI wonder if I wouldn't be better served doing this with a hash table of some sort so that I would have a lookup time that is O(1) instead of O(n).\n\n* * *\n\nNow, I know that I shouldn't optimize prematurely, and I may not have this problem at all, but remember, this is just the background, and there may be cases where this is really the best solution, regardless of whether it is the best solution for _my_ problem."

    "title": "cocktail party algorithm SVD implementation ... in one line of code?",
    "content": "In a slide within the introductory lecture on machine learning by Stanford's Andrew Ng at Coursera, he gives the following one line Octave solution to the cocktail party problem given the audio sources are recorded by two spatially separated microphones:\n\n```\n[W,s,v]=svd((repmat(sum(x.*x,1),size(x,1),1).*x)*x');\n```\n\nAt the bottom of the slide is \"source: Sam Roweis, Yair Weiss, Eero Simoncelli\" and at the bottom of an earlier slide is \"Audio clips courtesy of Te-Won Lee\". In the video, Professor Ng says,\n\n> \"So you might look at unsupervised learning like this and ask, 'How complicated is it to implement this?' It seems like in order to build this application, it seems like to do this audio processing, you would write a ton of code, or maybe link into a bunch of C++ or Java libraries that process audio. It seems like it would be a really complicated program to do this audio: separating out audio and so on. It turns out the algorithm to do what you just heard, that can be done with just one line of code ... shown right here. It did take researchers a long time to come up with this line of code. So I'm not saying this is an easy problem. But it turns out that when you use the right programming environment many learning algorithms will be really short programs.\"\n\nThe separated audio results played in the video lecture are not perfect but, in my opinion, amazing. Does anyone have any insight on how that one line of code performs so well? In particular, does anyone know of a reference that explains the work of Te-Won Lee, Sam Roweis, Yair Weiss, and Eero Simoncelli with respect to that one line of code?\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nTo demonstrate the algorithm's sensitivity to microphone separation distance, the following simulation (in Octave) separates the tones from two spatially separated tone generators.\n\n```\n% define model \nf1 = 1100;              % frequency of tone generator 1; unit: Hz \nf2 = 2900;              % frequency of tone generator 2; unit: Hz \nTs = 1/(40*max(f1,f2)); % sampling period; unit: s \ndMic = 1;               % distance between microphones centered about origin; unit: m \ndSrc = 10;              % distance between tone generators centered about origin; unit: m \nc = 340.29;             % speed of sound; unit: m / s \n\n% generate tones\nfigure(1);\nt = [0:Ts:0.025];\ntone1 = sin(2*pi*f1*t);\ntone2 = sin(2*pi*f2*t);\nplot(t,tone1); \nhold on;\nplot(t,tone2,'r'); xlabel('time'); ylabel('amplitude'); axis([0 0.005 -1 1]); legend('tone 1', 'tone 2');\nhold off;\n\n% mix tones at microphones\n% assume inverse square attenuation of sound intensity (i.e., inverse linear attenuation of sound amplitude)\nfigure(2);\ndNear = (dSrc - dMic)/2;\ndFar = (dSrc + dMic)/2;\nmic1 = 1/dNear*sin(2*pi*f1*(t-dNear/c)) + \\\n       1/dFar*sin(2*pi*f2*(t-dFar/c));\nmic2 = 1/dNear*sin(2*pi*f2*(t-dNear/c)) + \\\n       1/dFar*sin(2*pi*f1*(t-dFar/c));\nplot(t,mic1);\nhold on;\nplot(t,mic2,'r'); xlabel('time'); ylabel('amplitude'); axis([0 0.005 -1 1]); legend('mic 1', 'mic 2');\nhold off;\n\n% use svd to isolate sound sources\nfigure(3);\nx = [mic1' mic2'];\n[W,s,v]=svd((repmat(sum(x.*x,1),size(x,1),1).*x)*x');\nplot(t,v(:,1));\nhold on;\nmaxAmp = max(v(:,1));\nplot(t,v(:,2),'r'); xlabel('time'); ylabel('amplitude'); axis([0 0.005 -maxAmp maxAmp]); legend('isolated tone 1', 'isolated tone 2');\nhold off;\n```\n\nAfter about 10 minutes of execution on my laptop computer, the simulation generates the following three figures illustrating the two isolated tones have the correct frequencies.\n\n![Figure 1](https://i.stack.imgur.com/5FOS9.png) ![Figure 2](https://i.stack.imgur.com/TyU8G.png) ![Figure 3](https://i.stack.imgur.com/83RI2.png)\n\nHowever, setting the microphone separation distance to zero (i.e., dMic = 0) causes the simulation to instead generate the following three figures illustrating the simulation could not isolate a second tone (confirmed by the single significant diagonal term returned in svd's s matrix).\n\n![Figure 1 with no mic separation](https://i.stack.imgur.com/q9QbR.png) ![Figure 2 with no mic separation](https://i.stack.imgur.com/qpaGo.png) ![Figure 3 with no mic separation](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KKUp1.png)\n\nI was hoping the microphone separation distance on a smartphone would be large enough to produce good results but setting the microphone separation distance to 5.25 inches (i.e., dMic = 0.1333 meters) causes the simulation to generate the following, less than encouraging, figures illustrating higher frequency components in the first isolated tone.\n\n![Figure 1 on smartphone](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y62sE.png) ![Figure 2 on smartphone](https://i.stack.imgur.com/auJGT.png) ![Figure 3 on smartphone](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vslRE.png)"

    "content": "_This question arose out of something strange that I noticed after investigating [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/4222257/52738) further..._\n\nI always understood MATLAB variables to be [double-precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format) by default. So, if I were to do something like declare a variable with 20 digits after the decimal point:\n\n```\n>> num = 2.71828182845904553488;\n>> class(num)  % Display the variable type\nans =\ndouble\n```\n\nI would expect the last 4 digits to be ignored, since the [floating-point relative accuracy](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/eps.html) is on the order of 10\\-16:\n\n```\n>> eps(num)\nans =\n    4.440892098500626e-016\n```\n\nIf I try to display the number with more than 16 digits after the decimal point (using either [`fprintf`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fprintf.html) or [`sprintf`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/sprintf.html)), I get what I expect to see:\n\n```\n>> fprintf('%0.20f\\n', num)\n2.71828182845904550000\n>> sprintf('%0.20f', num)\nans =\n2.71828182845904550000\n```\n\nIn other words, digits 17 through 20 are all 0.\n\nBut things get weird when I pass `num` to the [variable precision arithmetic function](https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/vpa.html) in the [Symbolic Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/index.html), telling it to represent the number using 21 digits of precision:\n\n```\n>> vpa(num, 21)\nans =\n2.71828182845904553488\n```\n\n**WHAT?!** Those last 4 digits have reappeared! Shouldn't they have been lost when the original number I entered was stored as a double-precision variable `num`? Since `num` is a double-precision variable when it is passed to `vpa`, how did `vpa` know what they were?\n\nMy best guess as to what is happening is that MATLAB internally represents `num` with more precision than a double since I initialized it to a number with more digits past the decimal point than a double-precision variable could handle. Is this really what is happening, or is something else going on?\n\n  \n\n* * *\n\n**BONUS:** And here's an additional source of confusion if you don't already have a migraine from the above...\n\n```\n>> num = 2.71828182845904553488;  % Declare with 20 digits past the decimal\n>> num = 2.718281828459045531;    % Re-declare with 18 digits past the decimal\n>> vpa(num, 21)\nans =\n2.71828182845904553488  % It's the original 20-digit number!!!\n```"

Is there a better way of handling these name/value pairs? Are there any helper functions that come with MATLAB to assist?"
